*A **Netatmo Weather Station** Web-APP for Raspberry Pi &amp; official Raspberry touchscreen.*

For my Netatmo Weather Station I was looking for a display information to have a quick look of the measures done by the station. I looked at the WEB to find something but finally don't find what I was really thinking. Then, I decied to use one of my Pi to develop a small touch application. This app is now enough mature so I think it's a good idea to share my work for somewho want to used it.

Feel free to fork this repo and modify it like you need. I will also be happy to have any feedback from you or if you are not developer and want some change don't hesitate to contact me.

Currently this is a work in progress rewrite of my current APP which include **Netatmo API, Google Calendar API, Swiss Weather forcaste API and WebcamTravel API**. For this public release I am going to remove Google Cal API, WebcamTraval API and change Swiss Weather API by Dark Sky API.

## Development
This project is a Web APP writte mainly in Javascript and use the following technologies :
* ExpressJS (NodeJS framework)
* React / Redux
